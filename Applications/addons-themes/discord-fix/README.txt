IF and WHEN discord updates and breaks again......
Install this script with GreaseMonkey to get Discord working again.

It will access the older 2019 discord layout which works fine with
older Mozilla based browsers.

To install:
Open the script in a text editor (not TextEdit as it screws up formatting)
Select all, copy, then open greasemonkey -> new userscript -> paste from clipboard.
