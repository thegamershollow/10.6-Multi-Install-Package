This option rebuilds the LaunchServices allowing to remove the links between documents and applications.<br/><br/> When you open a new type of document for the first time, you are presented with an alert message. You then have several options: allow your document to be opened by the application to which the System defaulted, let the Finder display this application in its surrounding subfolder, or cancel opening the document. Once opened a first time, the link between this type of document and the application which executed it is stored. Also stored are all installed applications, your choices of specific applications to open specific types of documents, as well as your choice of a default web browser.<br/><br/>After rebuilding, double-clicking files or web-links may call unexpected applications. To change that back to your preferred settings, select a file of the desired type in the Finder, choose "File/Get Info" (Apple-I), select the application you prefer from the list of available choices in the Open With menu, then click Change All to tell the Finder that all similar files shall call that same application. The default web browser can be redefined in any browser's Preferences pane. It allows you to also correct misc. problems: Display of duplicate applications or applications that have been deleted in the shortcut menu's Open With command, Icons not in conformity with certain files and folders, and opening of the wrong application when double-clicking on a document.</p>
