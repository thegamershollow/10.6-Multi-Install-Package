Mac OS X incorporates a subsystem based on a UNIX-style operating system that uses permissions in the file system. Every file and folder on your hard disk has an associated set of permissions that determines who can read, write to, or execute it. <br/><br/>Many things you install in Mac OS X are installed from package files (.pkg files). Each time something is installed from a package file, a "Bill of Materials" file (.bom file) is stored in the package's receipt file, which is kept in a System folder. Each of those .bom files contains a list of the files installed by that package, and the proper permissions for each file. <br/><br/>When you use Maintenance to verify and repair disk permissions, it reviews each of the .bom files and compares its list to the actual permissions on each file listed. If the permissions differ, Maintenance corrects the difference. If you remove receipts or .bom files from /Library/Receipts/, the files installed by the packages cannot be verified or repaired, which is why you shouldn't delete things from /Library/Receipts/.<br/><br/>Maintenance repairs these permissions but doesn't repair documents or home folder items.</p>
